This is my conifguration for the suckless utility "DWM". 

I have two patches on this build currently

1) Full-gaps: Adds an appropriate gap between windows
2) Switch to tag: Broken at the moment, will eventually configure to make firefox to tag 9(like awesomewm)

I have added pywal compatibility to this dwm as well. This is not a finshed build.
